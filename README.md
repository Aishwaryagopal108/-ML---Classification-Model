Breast Cancer Classification using Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods

Project Description:
The objective of this project was to explore the use of Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning Methods for classification tasks using the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-learn.
The dataset included various medical features describing breast cancer cell samples, with the target variable indicating whether the cancer was malignant or benign.

Overall Outcome:
The project demonstrated the strengths and limitations of individual Decision Trees compared to ensemble-based approaches like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
Through feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, I was able to improve classification accuracy and gain valuable insights into which medical features were most predictive for breast cancer diagnosis.
